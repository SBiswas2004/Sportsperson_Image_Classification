  <h1>Sportsperson Image Classification</h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a machine learning-based web application that identifies specific sportspersons from uploaded facial images.
    It uses classical image processing techniques along with a trained classification model to recognize individual athletes
    such as cricketers, footballers, and tennis players. The system extracts facial features using wavelet transformation,
    combines them with raw pixel data, and uses a pre-trained model to predict the name of the sportsperson.
